The ability to execute these movements reliably and accurately – ‘skill,’ can be studied by assessing speed-accuracy trade-offs (SAF). Here we used the SAF framework to empirically investigate skill acquisition with a closed-loop interface that uses EMG feedback, during a functional prosthesis force-control task. Preliminary results suggest that over 3 days the SAF shifts vertically upwards, while its shape remains consistent. Faster grasping remained less accurate compared to when participants used the supplementary feedback to carefully guide their behavior. We believe that studying the SAF not only enables us to quantify skill acquisition or learning effects, but also to more broadly understand the performance characteristics of closed-loop user-prosthesis interfaces.","tags":["Prosthesis","Supplementary Feedback","Motor Control"],"title":"Skill acquisition in prosthesis force control with supplementary EMG Feedback","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Pranav Mamidanna","Jakob Lund Dideriksen","Strahinja Dosen"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, we still lack an understanding of how users make use of these interfaces, and how to evaluate competing interfaces. In this study we use the framework of speed accuracy trade off functions (SAF) to understand, evaluate and compare the performance afforded by two closed loop user prosthesis interfaces. Approach: Ten able bodied participants and one amputee performed a force matching task in a functional box and blocks setup at 3 different speeds. All participants were subject to both interfaces in a crossover fashion with a one week washout period. Importantly, both interfaces used (identical) direct proportional control but differed in the feedback provided to the participant: EMG feedback vs force feedback. We thereby estimated the SAFs afforded by the two interfaces, and additionally sought to understand how participants planned and executed the task in the various conditions. Main results: We found that execution speed significantly influenced the performance, and that EMG feedback afforded better performance overall. Notably, we found that there was a difference in SAF between the two interfaces, with EMG feedback enabling participants to attain higher accuracies faster than Force feedback. Further, both interfaces enabled participants to develop flexible control policies, while EMG feedback also afforded participants to generate smoother more repeatable EMG commands. Significance: Overall, the results indicate that closed loop prosthesis interfaces afford users to exhibit a wide range of performance, which is affected both by the interface and the execution speed. Thereby, we argue that it is important to consider the speed accuracy trade offs to rigorously evaluate and compare (closed loop) user prosthesis interfaces.","tags":["Prosthesis","Sensory Feedback","Motor Control"],"title":"Estimating Speed-Accuracy Trade-offs to Evaluate and Understand Closed-Loop Prosthesis Interfaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pranav Mamidanna","Jakob Lund Dideriksen","Strahinja Dosen"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, the impact of feedback depends on multiple factors and there is insufficient understanding about the fundamental role of such feedback in prosthesis use. The framework of human motor control enables us to systematically investigate the user-prosthesis control loop. In this study, we explore how different task objectives such as speed and accuracy shape the control policy developed by participants in a prosthesis force-matching task. Approach. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups that both used identical electromyography control interface and prosthesis force feedback, through vibrotactile stimulation, to perform a prosthesis force-matching task. However, the groups received different task objectives specifying speed and accuracy demands. We then investigated the control policies developed by the participants. To this end, we not only evaluated how successful or fast participants were but also analyzed the behavioral strategies adopted by the participants to obtain such performance gains. Main results. First, we observed that participants successfully integrated supplemental prosthesis force feedback to develop both feedforward and feedback control policies, as demanded by the task objectives. We then observed that participants who first developed a (slow) feedback policy were quickly able to adapt their policy to more stringent speed demands, by switching to a combined feedforward-feedback control strategy. However, the participants who first developed a (fast) feedforward policy were not able to change their control policy and adjust to greater accuracy demands. Significance. Overall, the results signify how the framework of human motor control can be applied to study the role of feedback in user-prosthesis interaction. The results also reveal the utility of training prosthesis users to integrate supplemental feedback into their state estimation by designing training protocols that encourage the development of combined feedforward and feedback policy.","tags":["EMG","Prostheses","Sensory Feedback"],"title":"The impact of objective functions on control policies in closed-loop control of grasping force with a myoelectric prosthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pranav Mamidanna","Kai J Sandbrink","Claudio Michaelis","Mackenzie Weygandt Mathis","Matthias Bethge","Alexander Mathis"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Muscles are flexible and undergo continuous changes requiring distributed adaptive control mechanisms. How proprioception solves this problem in the brain is unknown. Here we pursue a task-driven modeling approach that has provided important insights into other sensory systems. However, unlike for vision and audition where large annotated datasets of raw images or sound are readily available, data of relevant proprioceptive stimuli are not. We generated a large-scale dataset of human arm trajectories as the hand is tracing the alphabet in 3D space, then using a musculoskeletal model derived the spindle firing rates during these movements. We propose an action recognition task that allows training of hierarchical models to classify the character identity from the spindle firing patterns. Artificial neural networks could robustly solve this task, and the networks’ units show directional movement tuning akin to neurons in the primate somatosensory cortex. The same architectures with random weights also show similar kinematic feature tuning but do not reproduce the diversity of preferred directional tuning nor do they have invariant tuning across 3D space. Taken together our model is the first to link tuning properties in the proprioceptive system to the behavioral level.","tags":["Mathematical Modelling","Proprioception","Neuroscience","Neural Networks"],"title":"Contrasting action and posture coding with hierarchical deep neural network models of proprioception","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tuce Tombaz","Benjamin A.

In primates, this network links performed and observed actions via mirror neurons, which fire both when individuals perform an action and when they observe the same action performed by a conspecific. Mirror neurons are believed to be important for social learning, but it is not known whether mirror-like neurons occur in similar networks in other social species, such as rodents, or if they can be measured in such models using paradigms where observers passively view a demonstrator. Therefore, we imaged Ca2+ responses in PPC and secondary motor cortex (M2) while mice performed and observed pellet-reaching and wheel-running tasks, and found that cell populations in both areas robustly encoded several naturalistic behaviours. However, neural responses to the same set of observed actions were absent, although we verified that observer mice were attentive to performers and that PPC neurons responded reliably to visual cues. Statistical modelling also indicated that executed actions outperformed observed actions in predicting neural responses. These results raise the possibility that sensorimotor action recognition in rodents could take place outside of the parieto-frontal circuit, and underscore that detecting socially-driven neural coding depends critically on the species and behavioural paradigm used.","tags":["Neuroscience","Mirror Neurons"],"title":"Action representation in the mouse parieto-frontal network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Mathis","Pranav Mamidanna","Kevin M.

Videography provides easy methods for the observation and recording of animal behavior in diverse settings, yet extracting particular aspects of a behavior for further analysis can be highly time consuming. In motor control studies, humans or other animals are often marked with reflective markers to assist with computer-based tracking, but markers are intrusive, and the number and location of the markers must be determined a priori. Here we present an efficient method for markerless pose estimation based on transfer learning with deep neural networks that achieves excellent results with minimal training data. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework by tracking various body parts in multiple species across a broad collection of behaviors. Remarkably, even when only a small number of frames are labeled (~200), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy.","tags":["Neuroscience","Pose Estimation","Markerless Tracking","Computer Vision"],"title":"DeepLabCut: markerless pose estimation of user-defined body parts with deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://example.com/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
